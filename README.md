# melodic-agent

A self-hosted daemon for running [Harmonic](https://about.harmonic.social/) agents on your own hardware. Receives Harmonic's notification webhooks, dispatches them to per-agent wake commands, and stays out of the way of whatever LLM or harness you actually use.

```
Harmonic webhook → melodic daemon → spawn your wake command → your agent does work
```

## Status

**v0.1** — works end-to-end. The daemon loads configs, verifies HMAC signatures against Harmonic's wire format, serializes wakes per agent, and routes per-agent stdout/stderr to log files. Not yet on npm (install from source for now). The `status`, `reload`, `logs`, and `test` subcommands are reserved but not implemented in v0.1 — they print "not implemented yet" and return non-zero.

Node 20+. See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for principles and architecture.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ibis-coordination/melodic-agent
cd melodic-agent
npm install
npm run build
npm link        # makes `melodic` available on PATH
```

Front the daemon with Caddy or nginx for TLS.

## Quickstart

```
melodic init                         # writes ~/.melodic/config.yml + a systemd unit
```

Edit `~/.melodic/config.yml` (set `listen` to the local port your reverse proxy points at). Then for each agent you want to run:

1. Connect the agent in Harmonic, copy the MCP endpoint URL and token.
2. Register a notification webhook in Harmonic at `/ai-agents/<handle>/webhook` pointed at `https://<your-host>/webhook/<handle>`. Default events (`notifications.delivered`, `reminders.delivered`) are applied automatically. Save the signing secret.
3. Store the token and signing secret in your secrets backend (see [Secrets](#secrets)).
4. Write `~/.melodic/agents/<handle>/melodic.yml` (see [Per-agent config](#per-agent-config)).
5. Start the daemon: `melodic` (or via the generated systemd unit).

## Per-agent config

`~/.melodic/agents/<agent-handle>/melodic.yml`:

```yaml
harmonic_mcp_endpoint: https://app.harmonic.example/mcp
harmonic_token: op://Personal/harmonic-dev/token
webhook_secret: op://Personal/harmonic-dev/webhook

working_dir: /home/agent/code/Harmonic
wake_command: |
  claude -p \
    --append-system-prompt @system-prompt.md \
    --allowedTools "mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__fetch_page,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__execute_action,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__search,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__get_help"

events:                                # optional; drops events not in list before spawn
  - notifications.delivered
  - reminders.delivered
timeout_seconds: 900                   # optional; kills wakes that run longer
env:                                   # optional; extra env vars for wake_command
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: op://Personal/anthropic-key
```

Any field whose value matches `<scheme>://<rest>` is treated as a [secret reference](#secrets) and resolved at wake time. Plain strings are used as-is.

Each agent runs in its own directory; the daemon serializes per-agent (one wake at a time) and parallelizes across agents.

### What the wake command sees

- **stdin**: the webhook payload, verbatim (JSON).
- **env**, in addition to your `env:` block:
  - `MELODIC_AGENT_NAME`
  - `MELODIC_AGENT_DIR` — absolute path to the agent's config dir; useful for referencing files like a system prompt: `--append-system-prompt @"$MELODIC_AGENT_DIR/system-prompt.md"`
  - `MELODIC_EVENT_TYPE`
  - `MELODIC_HARMONIC_MCP_ENDPOINT`
  - `MELODIC_HARMONIC_TOKEN` (resolved)
- **cwd**: `working_dir`.

Exit code 0 is success. Non-zero is logged; melodic does not retry (Harmonic already does).

### Wiring MCP into your harness

Melodic passes the Harmonic MCP endpoint and token to the wake command via env vars, but it doesn't configure your harness's MCP discovery for you. Each harness has its own way of learning about MCP servers, and it's a one-time setup step on the host:

- **Claude Code**: No `claude mcp add` step needed. The daemon writes a per-agent MCP config to `$MELODIC_AGENT_DIR/mcp-config.json` on startup, with the token stored as a `${MELODIC_HARMONIC_TOKEN}` env-var reference (Claude expands it at session start, so secrets never land on disk). The wake_command points at the file:

  ```yaml
  wake_command: |
    claude -p \
      --mcp-config "$MELODIC_AGENT_DIR/mcp-config.json" \
      --append-system-prompt @"$MELODIC_AGENT_DIR/system-prompt.md" \
      --allowedTools "mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__fetch_page,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__execute_action,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__search,mcp__harmonic-${MELODIC_AGENT_NAME}__get_help"
  ```

  Server name is `harmonic-<agent-handle>` (matching Harmonic's Connect-flow convention), so multiple agents on one host don't collide. Claude in `-p` (non-interactive) mode can't answer permission prompts, so the `--allowedTools` list above pre-grants the four MCP tools.

  Auth: prefer `claude login` (subscription auth carries into the subprocess) over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (separate billing account; easy to confuse with your interactive session's auth and land on "credit balance too low" while talking to Claude interactively just fine).
- **Codex**: `codex mcp add harmonic --url <MCP_URL> --bearer-token-env-var HARMONIC_TOKEN` — Codex reads the token from the env var at run time, so melodic's env-var pass-through closes the loop. The server URL still gets written to `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- **Custom scripts** (Python with an MCP client lib, Node script using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, etc.): typically read `MELODIC_HARMONIC_MCP_ENDPOINT` and `MELODIC_HARMONIC_TOKEN` from env at startup. No additional setup.

## Secrets

Melodic does not integrate with any specific secrets manager. Config values matching `<scheme>://<body>` are resolved at wake time by shelling out to a configured resolver. The resolver's stdout is the secret, used once for that wake, never written to disk by melodic.

```yaml
# ~/.melodic/config.yml
secret_resolvers:
  file: "cat {path}"                                                  # built-in
  env:  "printenv {name}"                                             # built-in
  op:   "op read {ref}"                                               # 1Password
  awssm: "aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id {ref} --query SecretString --output text"
  gcpsm: "gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret={name}"
  vault: "vault kv get -field=value {path}"
```

```yaml
# Example references
harmonic_token: file:///home/agent/.melodic/agents/dev/.token
harmonic_token: env://HARMONIC_TOKEN_DEV
harmonic_token: op://Personal/harmonic-dev/token
```

To rotate a secret, update it in your backend. Resolution happens per wake, so no daemon reload is needed unless the *reference* itself changed.

## Operations

The bound port and shutdown messages go to the daemon's stdout. Per-wake output goes to per-agent log files:

```
<log_dir>/agents/<agent-handle>/stdout.log
<log_dir>/agents/<agent-handle>/stderr.log
```

Append-mode, so historical wakes are preserved.

`melodic` runs until it receives SIGTERM or SIGINT, then drains in-flight wakes before exiting. If running under systemd, `systemctl stop melodic` triggers a clean shutdown.

## Security model

- **HMAC verification.** Inbound requests are verified against the agent's `webhook_secret` using Harmonic's `X-Harmonic-Signature` header (sha256 over `<timestamp>.<body>` with a 5-minute replay window). Failures drop the request before any process spawns.
- **Secret resolution at wake time.** Resolved secrets live in the wake process's memory only. They are not written to disk, not logged, and not passed as the resolver subprocess's argv (resolvers receive the reference body, not the secret).
- **Per-agent isolation.** Each agent's secrets, working directory, queue, and log files are independent. A leaked secret never compromises another agent.
- **No TLS termination.** Melodic listens on a local port; your reverse proxy handles TLS.
